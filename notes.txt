1. Create a form with a minimum of 4 pieces of criteria to validate (ex. Name/Price/Description/Expiration Date)

2. If there is any invalid data error messages should be shown

3. Invalid input should display errors on the page, not in alert boxes

4. Error messages should be descriptive

5. If all input is valid the data should be displayed below the form

6. You may choose how to display the data. Ex. Using heading/paragraphs/lists/etc

7. Validation must be done in JavaScript or TypeScript NOT HTML ATTRIBUTES

8. Project must be stored on GitHub and commits must be used. Minimum 7 commits

9. Create a class and use an object of that type. Displaying data using an object is a simple way to achieve this and will be covered in lecture
